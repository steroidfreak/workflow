          <h1>Privacy Policy for Workflow SG&apos;s WhatsApp Experiences</h1>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Workflow SG Pte. Ltd. ("Workflow SG", "we",
            "us" or "our") collects, uses, and protects personal data when organisations
            connect their WhatsApp Business accounts to Workflow SG products. It also
            explains the choices available to administrators, agents, and end-users who
            interact with these messaging services.
          </p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Scope &amp; relationship with Meta</h2>
          <p>
            Workflow SG provides workflow automation and customer engagement tooling used
            by Singapore-based teams. When you authorise our integration inside Meta&apos;s
            Business Manager, you instruct Workflow SG to process WhatsApp Business Account
            data on your behalf. Meta remains the primary data controller for WhatsApp, while
            Workflow SG acts as your data intermediary and processor to deliver the requested
            services.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
          <p>Depending on how you configure the integration, we may process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account identifiers</strong> such as WhatsApp Business Account IDs,
              phone numbers, display names, and verification status provided via Meta APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conversation records</strong> including opt-ins, message templates,
              delivery receipts, media metadata, and agent notes that flow through your
              workspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operational telemetry</strong> like integration health signals,
              automation triggers, escalation events, and API error codes generated by our
              platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Administrative details</strong> such as the names, emails, and roles of
              administrators configuring the integration within Workflow SG.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not require or request end-user account credentials for Meta or WhatsApp.
            Sensitive information contained in message payloads remains encrypted in transit
            and at rest as described below.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. How we use WhatsApp data</h2>
          <p>Workflow SG processes WhatsApp data solely to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deliver and orchestrate conversations that your organisation initiates or receives.</li>
            <li>Provide analytics dashboards, audit trails, and automation playbooks requested by your team.</li>
            <li>Monitor service quality, detect abuse, and maintain platform security.</li>
            <li>Comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, and Meta platform policies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell WhatsApp data or use it to build advertising profiles. Data from
            WhatsApp is segregated from other Workflow SG customer environments and is not
            combined for cross-customer analytics without explicit consent.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Sharing &amp; disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            Workflow SG does not disclose WhatsApp data to third parties except in the
            following circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service providers:</strong> vetted infrastructure partners (such as
              hosting, security monitoring, and support tooling) who process data under
              contractual confidentiality and data protection obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> when necessary to comply with court orders,
              regulatory requests, or to enforce our Terms of Service. We will notify the
              customer unless legally prohibited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customer direction:</strong> when administrators export data, enable
              connectors, or grant access to additional parties within their organisation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            WhatsApp conversation records and associated automation logs are retained for the
            duration of your active contract and may be configured for shorter retention in
            accordance with your compliance policies. When a customer disables the
            integration or requests deletion, Workflow SG deletes or anonymises WhatsApp data
            within 30 days unless a longer period is required by law.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Security safeguards</h2>
          <p>
            Workflow SG implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards aligned
            with ISO 27001 and Singapore PDPA expectations, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.</li>
            <li>Role-based access controls with just-in-time elevation for support engineers.</li>
            <li>Continuous monitoring, intrusion detection, and audit logging.</li>
            <li>Annual penetration testing and vulnerability remediation.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. International data transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Workflow SG hosts production services in Singapore. If support or redundancy
            requires a transfer outside Singapore, we rely on contractual safeguards and only
            work with partners that maintain comparable data protection standards.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
          <p>
            Customers may access, correct, export, or delete WhatsApp data at any time via
            the Workflow SG admin console or by contacting our support desk. End-users who
            wish to exercise PDPA or GDPR rights should first contact the organisation that
            sent them messages; we will support our customer in addressing the request.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect product enhancements or regulatory
            changes. Material updates will be communicated to administrators via email and
            in-product notices at least 14 days before the new terms take effect.
          </p>
